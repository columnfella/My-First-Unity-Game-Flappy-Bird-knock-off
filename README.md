### **Flappy Bird Clone - My First Game**  

Welcome to my first-ever Unity game! ðŸŽ® This is a simple **Flappy Bird clone** made to kickstart my game development journey. The code might be messy, but itâ€™s all part of the learning process.  

*<span style="color:red">For any of you GameDev enthusiasts</span>*, you might recognize some assets and code of this repository from somewhere else, specifically from this famous YouTube tutorial:

Though I've made some personal additions to the code, so it's not 100% identical to the tutorial.

### As I've mentioned before, this repository is just the starting point of my learning journey.

Thank you for playing!
